-- | Give two list of cards, which are called "target" and "guess"  
--   then use five other functions to get five feedback numbers as a tuple.
feedback :: [Card] -> [Card] -> (Int, Int, Int, Int, Int)

        rankMatch (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s), greaterRank (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s), 
        suitMatch (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s))


-- | Give two lists of cards (target, guess), returns the number of cards in 
--   the target and also in the guess.
exactMatch :: [Card] -> [Card] -> Int
exactMatch (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s)= length (filter (== True) 
                              [ c1 == c2 | c1 <- (c1:c1s), c2 <- (c2:c2s)])


-- | Give two list of cards (target, guess), returns the number of cards in 
--   the target having rank lower than the lowest rank in the guess."rank" is 
--   the function used to get the rank a card.
lessRank :: [Card] -> [Card] -> Int
lessRank (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s) = length (filter (< minimum 
                              (map rank (c2:c2s))) (map rank(c1:c1s)))


-- | Give two list of cards (target, guess), returns the number of cards in 
--   the target have the same rank as a card in the guess. "intersection" 
--   funcion on the Data.List library can not be used inthis case, because 
--   this function will remove deplicate element in the list. Therefore, we 
--   define our own funcitons called "intersectRank" and "intersectSuit" to 
--   get the intersection part of two lists of cards.
rankMatch :: [Card] -> [Card] -> Int 
rankMatch c1s c2s = length (intersectRank (map rank c1s) (map rank c2s ))


-- | Give two lists of cards (target, guess), returns the number of cards in 
--   the target having rank higher than the highest rank in the guess.
greaterRank :: [Card] -> [Card] -> Int
greaterRank (c1:c1s) (c2:c2s) = length (filter (> maximum 
                                (map rank (c2:c2s))) (map rank (c1:c1s)))


-- | Give two lists of cards (target, guess), returns the number of cards in 
--   the target having the same suit as a card in the guess. "suit" is the 
--   function used to get the suit of a card.
suitMatch :: [Card] -> [Card] -> Int
suitMatch c1s c2s = length (intersectSuit (map suit c1s) (map suit c2s ))


-- | Give two lists of cards' suit, then returns the intersection suit and 
--   keep the duplicate suit in the intersection 
intersectSuit :: [Suit] -> [Suit] -> [Suit]
intersectSuit c1s c2s = c1s\\(c1s\\c2s)


-- | Give two lists of cards' rank, then returns the intersection rank and
--   keep the duplicate rank in the intersection
intersectRank :: [Rank] -> [Rank] -> [Rank]
intersectRank c1s c2s = c1s\\(c1s\\c2s)


-- | This funciton takes numbers of cards in the answer as input, then
--   then returns a list of specifid cards and a GameState sotred the list
--   of remaining possible answers, which is a list of card lists. In 
--   this project, we only consider 2-4 cards cases, so iuput other number 
--   of cards will get an error message. "gs2", "gs3", "gs4" means all 
--   remaining possible answers for 2 cards, 3 cards and 4 cards. For 
--   example, all possible answers for 2 cards are 52*51/2 = 1326, beacuse
--   we ingore the order of cards and we just assume first card is smaller
--   than second card (c1 < c2).

-- | After we get the feedback of the guess, we use it to pare the gamestate
--   step by step, which means shrink the range of remaining possible answers. 
--   For each guess, we only keep the possible answers has the same feedback 
--   as previous guess.
